      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I'm Alan Van — a first-generation Vietnamese-American studying Computer Science at the
        <a href="https://www.uml.edu/">University of Massachusetts Lowell</a>, with a concentration in Cybersecurity.
        I’m passionate about building things, understanding how systems work, and using those skills to create real impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond academics, I’m constantly building — whether it’s code, custom PCs, or personal projects.
        I enjoy diving into how things work under the hood and finding practical ways to apply that knowledge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through hands-on experiences like co-founding
        <a href="https://www.haverhillcomputers.com/">Haverhill Computers</a>
        and completing a range of coding projects through school assignments, I’m learning what it takes to build real things,
        both in software and hardware.
