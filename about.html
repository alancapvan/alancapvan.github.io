            About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
            I’m Alan Van, a Computer Science student at the University of Massachusetts Lowell with a focus on
            Cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond academics, I’m constantly building, whether it’s code, custom PCs, or personal projects.
            I’m passionate about understanding how systems work under the hood and finding practical ways to apply that
            knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through hands-on experiences like co-founding Haverhill Computers and completing a range of coding projects
            through school assignments,
            I’m learning what it takes to build real things, both in software and hardware.
