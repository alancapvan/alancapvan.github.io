            About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
            I'm Alan Van — a first-generation Vietnamese-American studying Computer Science at the 
            <a href="https://www.uml.edu/">University of Massachusetts Lowell</a>, with a concentration in Cybersecurity. 
            I’m passionate about building things, understanding how systems work, and using those skills to create real impact.
        </p>          
        <p>
            Beyond academics, I’m constantly building, whether it’s code, custom PCs, or personal projects.
            I’m passionate about understanding how systems work under the hood and finding practical ways to apply that knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through hands-on experiences like co-founding 
            <a href="https://www.haverhillcomputers.com/">Haverhill Computers</a> 
            and completing a range of coding projects through school assignments, I’m learning what it takes to build real things, 
            both in software and hardware.
