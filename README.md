# Alan Van â€“ Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, academic background, and interests in computer science and cybersecurity.

This is the first website Iâ€™ve ever built, and it also marks my introduction to HTML and CSS. Itâ€™s a hands-on way for me to explore front-end development while learning how to design and deploy a website from scratch.
