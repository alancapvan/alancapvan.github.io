                Haverhill Computers is where passion meets practice. I started it with two friends who share a love for
                computers,
                from building and repairing hardware to designing software and managing digital tools. Through this
                startup,
                I‚Äôve gained real experience in PC assembly, troubleshooting, web development, branding, and running a
                business from
                the ground up.
