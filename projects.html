            </h3>
            <p>
                Haverhill Computers is where passion meets practice. I started it with two friends who share a love for
                computers, from building and repairing hardware to designing software and managing digital tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this startup, I’ve gained real experience in PC assembly, troubleshooting, web development,
                branding, and running a business from the ground up.

            <p>
                A full compilation of my course projects for Computing IV in C++, compiled in LaTeX. Created as the
                final project for the class, it covers topics such as memory management, class design, and operator
                overloading.
