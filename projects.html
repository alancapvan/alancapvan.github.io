        <h3>🖥️ Haverhill Computers</h3>
        <p>
          Haverhill Computers is where passion meets practice. I started it with two friends who share a love for computers —
          from building and repairing hardware to designing software and managing digital tools.
          Through this startup, I’ve gained real experience in PC assembly, troubleshooting, web development,
          branding, and running a business from the ground up.
