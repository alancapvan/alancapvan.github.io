            <p>
                Haverhill Computers is where passion meets practice. I started it with two friends who share a love for
                computers, from building and repairing hardware to designing software and managing digital tools. <br />
                Through this startup, I‚Äôve gained real experience in PC assembly, troubleshooting, web development,
                branding, and running a business from the ground up. <br />
